# Security

Security is of utmost importance to all packages I worked on.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any package, please ping me in the [discord #general channel](https://discord.gg/RwzcFpN5fv).
I'll create a private discord channel where we can talk about the vulnerability.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**
